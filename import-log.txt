(node:92630) ExperimentalWarning: Type Stripping is an experimental feature and might change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
(node:92630) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/JackEllis/Pretty%20Presentations/pretty-presentations/scripts/import-influencers.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/JackEllis/Pretty Presentations/pretty-presentations/package.json.
ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
