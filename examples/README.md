# Brief Examples Reference Guide

This directory contains **8 real-world brief examples** showing the variety of client requests received daily via email. These examples are used to train and improve the AI brief parser.

## 📧 About These Examples

These are **actual email formats** that an influencer marketing agency receives:
- Conversational greetings and sign-offs
- Information scattered throughout paragraphs
- Emojis and informal Spanish business communication
- External links (WeTransfer, Instagram handles, TikTok profiles)
- References to previous campaigns and meetings

5. **Incomplete info handling** (acknowledge gaps, don't fabricate)
6. **Creator mentions** (names, handles, rejected options)
7. **Campaign type identification** (B2B, event-based, social cause, etc.)
8. **Special requirements** (CPM limits, in-store %, embargos, geographic)
