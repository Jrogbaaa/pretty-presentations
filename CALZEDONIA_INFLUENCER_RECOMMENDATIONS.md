## 🎯 KEY TALKING POINTS FOR PITCH

### Why These Influencers (vs. Their Current Celebrities):

**Current Strategy:** Very high-profile celebrities (Irina Shayk, Kendall Jenner, Sara Carbonero)

**Recommended Strategy:** Engaged mid-tier influencers (<500K)
- **Cost:** €70K - €175K per partnership (60-90% cost savings)
- **Authenticity:** Higher perceived authenticity with audience
- **Engagement:** 2-20% rates (5-10x higher than mega-influencers)
- **ROI:** Better cost-per-engagement and conversion rates
