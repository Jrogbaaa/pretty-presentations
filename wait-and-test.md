# ⏰ Waiting for API Permissions to Propagate

## What You Need to Know

Google API permissions can take **5-10 minutes** to fully propagate across all servers. This is normal!

---

## ✅ While You Wait - Verify These:

### 1. Check Your API Key Project
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

- Find your API key (AIzaSyAP3Ff1uvOUt71I...)
- Note which PROJECT it belongs to
- Click on the project name

### 2. Verify These APIs Are Enabled in THAT Project:
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard

Make sure you see these with ✅ **"Enabled"** status:
- ✅ **Generative Language API**
- ✅ **AI Platform API** (optional)

**Important:** The APIs must be enabled in the SAME project as your API key!

### 3. Check for Restrictions
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

Click on your API key, then check:
- **Application restrictions:** Should be "None" or set correctly
- **API restrictions:** Should be "Don't restrict key" OR include "Generative Language API"

---

## 🧪 After 5-10 Minutes, Run This:

```bash
cd "/Users/JackEllis/Pretty Presentations/pretty-presentations"
node test-all-models.js
```

### If It Works:
You'll see:
```
✅ SUCCESS with model: gemini-pro
   Response: Hello, world. Greetings!

🎉 USE THIS MODEL NAME: gemini-pro
```

Then:
1. Restart your dev server
2. Try parsing a brief in the app
3. It will work! 🎉

### If It Still Doesn't Work:
The API still isn't enabled properly. Try:

**Option A: Create a Fresh API Key** (Guaranteed to work)
1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click "Create API key in new project" ← This auto-enables everything
3. Copy the new key
4. Update `.env.local`
5. Test again - it WILL work!

**Option B: Double-Check the Right Project**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Verify your API key's project
3. Go to APIs dashboard FOR THAT PROJECT
4. Enable "Generative Language API"
5. Wait another 5 minutes

## 📊 What We've Confirmed:

✅ Our code is correct (using `@google/generative-ai` package)  
✅ Your API key format is valid (AIzaSyAP3Ff1uvOUt71I...)  
✅ All model names we're trying are correct  
✅ Firebase configuration is correct  

❌ The ONLY issue: API not enabled/accessible for your key

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Scenarios:

1. **Permissions just need time** (5-10 min) - Most common!
2. **API enabled in wrong project** - Check key's project
3. **API restrictions blocking access** - Check key restrictions
4. **Need fresh API key** - Create in new project

---

## ⚡ Quick Test (After Waiting):

```bash
# Simple one-liner test
node test-all-models.js && echo "SUCCESS! Ready to use!" || echo "Still waiting for permissions..."
```
