# Example Brief: Imagin - Cooking Presenters with Marc M치rquez Collaboration

## Original Email (Spanish)

Hola Gema, 
쮺칩mo est치s? 游뗵
Tenemos una nueva propuesta con imagin que est치 muy avanzada, pero como quieren cambios, aprovecho para involucraros, te la dejo por aqu칤: https://we.tl/t-QK6IvQGubt
Necesitar칤amos a침adir m치s opciones de Presentadores, pero vinculados a mundo cocina porque har치n algo con Marc M치rquez (a칰n TBC): 쯇odemos a침adirlos en la parte de presentadores ejemplo y en la de budget de estas nuevas caras? Como idea 2 - cocineros transversales. Ya han salido nombres como Dabiz Mu침oz, pero ha dicho que no. Tambi칠n hemos pensado en Carlos Maldonado, Jordi Cruz, Ale Vicio (ya que le tuvimos en el podcast), etc. La idea es que sean lo suficientemente reconocidos para que a Marc le guste el proyecto y quiera participar.
Tambi칠n ha salido este nombre, no s칠 si le conoc칠is y ten칠is feedback, pero a m칤 no me encaja: https://www.tiktok.com/@eliasdosunmu?lang=en
Tambi칠n si podemos a침adir invitados nuevos, que sean potentes y encajen en productos imagin, bienvenido es. 
쮺u치ndo podr칤amos a침adir estas slides nuevas? 
Si ten칠is dudas, nos llamamos.
Mil gracias!!!

## Key Insights from This Brief

### What Makes This Email Challenging:

1. **Mid-Process Entry:** Agency joining advanced proposal for modifications
2. **Celebrity Dependency:** Presenter quality affects Marc M치rquez participation
3. **No Budget Specified:** Need to add budget for new faces (amount unknown)
4. **Mixed Feedback:** One profile questioned by sender, seeking second opinion
5. **Rejection Context:** One target (Dabiz Mu침oz) already declined
6. **Broad Criteria:** "Transversal chefs" and "fit imagin" are vague
7. **External Reference:** WeTransfer link to existing proposal (not parseable)
8. **Uncertainty:** Marc M치rquez collaboration still TBC
9. **Timeline Vague:** When can slides be added? (timing question not deadline)
10. **Dual Roles:** Distinction between "Presentadores" and "invitados" (hosts vs guests)

### AI Should Prioritize:

- **Cooking World Focus:** All presenters must be linked to cooking/gastronomy
- **Celebrity Appeal:** Recognition level matters (Marc M치rquez criteria)

- Poor imagin brand fit
