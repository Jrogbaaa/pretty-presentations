## üîç Key Observations

### ‚úÖ System Successfully Adapted

**2. Different Scoring Results**
- Perfume: Scores 86, 84, 80 (higher due to stronger content match)
- IKEA: Scores 70, 69, 67 (lower because fewer exact category matches)

- Would NEVER appear in perfume campaign
- Perfect example of system working correctly

- IKEA: 51 matching influencers
- Suggests database has more Music/Entertainment than Home/Design influencers

## üö® IKEA Campaign Issues

### 1. Budget Exceeded by 33% ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** ‚Ç¨79,551 vs ‚Ç¨60,000 budget = 133% utilization
- Perfume was only 3% over (acceptable)
- IKEA is 33% over (NOT acceptable)

**Why This Happened:**
- IKEA has lower budget (‚Ç¨60K vs ‚Ç¨75K)
- System selected similar-sized influencers (380-405K followers)
- Budget optimization needs improvement for smaller budgets

**Solution Needed:**
- For budgets < ‚Ç¨65K, prioritize more micro influencers (10K-50K)
- Cap macro/mid-tier selection at 40% of budget
- Add stricter budget enforcement option

---

### 2. Much Lower Engagement ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** 18,347 total engagement vs 102,712 for perfume

**Why This Happened:**
- Perfume had 24.82% avg engagement (Sergio's 61.58% boosted this)
- IKEA has 4.41% avg engagement (more realistic)
- Home/Design content typically gets lower engagement than Entertainment/Music

**Is This Bad?**
- **NO** - This is actually realistic!
- Home/lifestyle content naturally has lower engagement than entertainment
- IKEA's 4.41% is still above industry average (1-2%)

---

### 3. Lower Match Scores
**Problem:** Max score 70/100 for IKEA vs 86/100 for perfume

**Why This Happened:**
- Content category matching is harder
- Database has fewer "Home," "DIY," "Design" influencers
- "Lifestyle" is too broad

**Is This Bad?**
- **NO** - Shows system is being selective
- Better to have 70/100 honest scores than inflated matches
- Indicates potential need for more home/design influencers in database

### What Needs Improvement üîß

2. **Content Category Diversity**

   - Weak in Home/DIY/Design (only found 51 vs 58)
   - Consider importing more home/lifestyle influencers

3. **Placeholder Filtering**
   - "NAME" and "Sevilla FC" still appearing
   - Need to filter out records with 0 followers
   - Should add data validation

4. **Micro Influencer Inclusion**
