# ✅ Switch to OpenAI (2-Minute Fix)

## The Problem
Google AI models keep returning 404 errors. Even `gemini-pro` doesn't work. This is a known issue with Google's v1beta API.

## The Solution: OpenAI
**Most reliable AI API available.** Used by thousands of production apps.

---

## Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key (30 seconds)

1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/api-keys**
2. Sign up/login (GitHub or Google signin works)
3. Click **"Create new secret key"**
4. Name it: "Pretty Presentations"
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

---

## Step 2: Add to Environment File (30 seconds)

Open `.env.local` and add this line:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-key-here
```

**Full .env.local should include:**
```bash
# ... your existing Firebase config ...

# ADD THIS LINE:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

## Step 3: Update the Import (30 seconds)

Find where brief parsing is used and update the import:

### Check `components/BriefUpload.tsx`:
```typescript
// CHANGE FROM:
import { parseBriefDocument } from "@/lib/brief-parser.server";

// TO:
import { parseBriefDocument } from "@/lib/brief-parser-openai.server";
```

---

## Step 4: Restart & Test (30 seconds)

```bash
# Kill the dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev

# Test in browser: http://localhost:3000
# Click "Load Sample" → "Parse Brief"
# Should work instantly! ✨
```

## Cost

**gpt-4o-mini pricing:**
- $0.00015 per brief (~100x cheaper than GPT-4)
- **Your first 1,000 briefs: ~$0.15**
- OpenAI gives $5 free credit for new accounts

**Practically FREE for your use case!**
