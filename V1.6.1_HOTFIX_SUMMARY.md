# v1.6.1 Hotfix Summary

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED - ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL**

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: TalentStrategySlide Component Missing

**Error:**
```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) 
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object. 
You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, 
or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check the render method of `SlideRenderer`.
```

**Root Cause:**
- The `components/slides/TalentStrategySlide.tsx` file was accidentally emptied during v1.6.1 deployment
- `SlideRenderer` attempted to render the component but received an empty object
- This broke the editor when viewing slides 9 (Talent Strategy)

**Fix:**
- Restored file content from git history (commit `50cbbd1`)
- Verified the component includes:
  - Engagement rate comparison bar chart
  - Rich influencer pool display with full demographics
  - Optimized layout (180px chart height, compact spacing)
  - 2-column grid with proper overflow protection
  - All TypeScript types and imports correct

**Commit:** `670157f` - "fix: Restore TalentStrategySlide component content"

### Issue 2: Rate Limiter Export Errors

**Errors:**
1. **Build Error:**
   ```
   Export RateLimitPresets doesn't exist in target module
   ```
   
2. **Runtime Error:**
   ```
   limiter.checkLimit is not a function
   ```

**Root Cause:**
- `lib/rate-limiter.ts` was missing exports for `RateLimitPresets` and proper `enforceRateLimit` function
- `brief-parser-openai.server.ts` tried to import and use these undefined exports
- Brief parsing broke completely

**Fix:**
- Exported `RateLimitConfig` interface
- Exported `RateLimiter` class
- Created `RateLimitPresets` object with common configurations
- Refactored `enforceRateLimit` to accept `(identifier, config, operation?)` instead of `(operation, limiter)`
- Added global `Map` to manage limiter instances per operation
- Created pre-configured limiters: `imageGenerationLimiter`, `imageEditLimiter`, `briefParsingLimiter`

**Commits:**
- `f3b053d` - "fix: Export RateLimitPresets and update enforceRateLimit"
- `f5eb7f5` - "fix: Refactor enforceRateLimit to accept identifier and config"

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

### What Went Wrong
1. **File Copy Operations**: During the initial v1.6.1 deployment, a file copy operation accidentally emptied `TalentStrategySlide.tsx`
2. **Export Oversight**: Rate limiter exports were not properly defined, causing downstream import errors
3. **Function Signature Mismatch**: `enforceRateLimit` expected different parameters than what was being passed

### Prevention Measures
1. **Always verify file contents after copy operations**
2. **Run TypeScript build before committing**
3. **Test critical user paths (brief → generate → edit) after deployment**
4. **Use git history as safety net for file recovery**

### What Went Right
1. **Fast Issue Detection**: Errors were caught and reported by user immediately
2. **Git History Saved Us**: Could restore TalentStrategySlide from commit `50cbbd1`
3. **Systematic Debugging**: Identified root causes quickly using error messages
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified all features working end-to-end before closing
